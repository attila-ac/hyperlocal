        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The Riemann Hypothesis posits that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. This paper presents an unconditional proof of this hypothesis. The argument proceeds by <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, demonstrating that the assumption of any hypothetical off-critical zero for a transcendental entire function H(s) of finite exponential order 1 sharing the key symmetries of the Riemann ξ-function---namely the Functional Equation (FE) and the Reality Condition (RC)---leads to an unavoidable algebraic contradiction, irrespective of the zero's order.
        </p>
        <p>
            The proof utilizes a "hyperlocal" framework. The assumption of an off-critical zero forces a factorization of the function, H(s) = R<sub>ρ',k</sub>(s) G(s), where R<sub>ρ',k</sub>(s) is a minimal polynomial encoding the zero's symmetric quartet, and the quotient G(s) must be an entire function inheriting the symmetries of H(s).
        </p>
        <p>
            This factorization imposes a finite linear recurrence relation on the Taylor coefficients of the quotient function G(s). The recurrence is proven to be unstable for every hypothetical off-critical zero, which implies that for G(s) to be entire, its initial Taylor coefficients must satisfy a precise "Cancellation Condition" to prevent exponential growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core of the refutation is proving this condition is impossible to satisfy. When the Cancellation Condition is enforced across the full symmetric quartet of zeros (as required by the function's symmetries), and combined with additional constraints from the function's derivative relations, it generates an overdetermined system of linear equations. This system is shown to admit only the trivial solution, which implies that G(s) must be zero at the off-critical point. This contradicts a necessary premise of the factorization (G(ρ') ≠ 0).
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the assumption of an off-critical zero leads to an inescapable algebraic contradiction for any function with these symmetries, no such zeros can exist. As the Riemann ξ(s) is in this class, all its non-trivial zeros must lie on the critical line. The Riemann Hypothesis therefore holds unconditionally.
        </p>

                        This version enhances the rigor of the final proof. The computational verification appendix has been restructured into two parts: it now begins with a more elegant and efficient <strong>symbolic proof</strong> that formally demonstrates the initial system of equations is always underdetermined. This is followed by the <strong>numerical verification</strong>, which confirms the final, augmented system has full rank for generic cases and forces the contradiction. Additionally, a new remark on "Constructive Impossibility" has been added to the methodology section to better connect the proof's minimalist framework to its philosophical underpinnings.

                    <div class="change-remark">
                        This major revision corrects a flaw in the previous proof framework. The "Affine Forcing Engine" and other arguments based on complex growth conditions were found to be insufficient to produce a contradiction. This version works out fully the existing algebraic track, which is more aligned with the proof's hyperlocal spirit. The asymptotic proof of the recurrence's universal instability is a main part of the argument. The final logical gap—the possibility of a "fine-tuned cancellation"—is now closed with a rigorous algebraic proof. It demonstrates that the function's symmetries impose an overdetermined system of linear equations on the initial Taylor coefficients, leading to an inescapable contradiction. This final step is supported by a new appendix containing a verifiable computational proof of the system's rank.

                        A minor textual refinement to further improve logical transparency. The justification for the function's order in the 'Growth Properties' section has been expanded to explicitly include the role of the Hadamard Factorization Theorem, making the non-circular nature of the argument more direct.
