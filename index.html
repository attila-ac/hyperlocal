        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The Riemann Hypothesis posits that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. This paper presents an unconditional proof of this hypothesis. The argument proceeds by reductio ad absurdum, demonstrating that the assumption of any hypothetical off-critical zero for an entire function H(s) sharing the key properties of the Riemann ξ-function—namely its symmetries (Functional Equation and Reality Condition) and its full class of growth constraints (finite order, vertical decay, and bounded horizontal growth)—leads to an unavoidable analytic contradiction, irrespective of the zero’s order. The proof utilizes a “constructive hyperlocal entirety test.” This involves applying the full force of theorems governing entire functions to the local analytic structure implied by a hypothetical off-critical zero. The core mechanism is an analytical engine that translates the function’s global symmetries and growth constraints into a fatal local constraint, rigorously proving that its derivative, H'(s), must be an affine polynomial. This conclusion is then shown to be impossible through two complete and independent lines of reasoning. The main proof refutes an off-critical zero of any order k ≥ 1 through a unified “Clash of Natures” argument, which proves that for a transcendental function, the necessary factorization around an off-critical zero is incompatible with its derivative being affine. A second, purely algebraic proof track, detailed in the appendix, confirms this result by showing that the affine structure is also directly incompatible with the Taylor series expansion of the derivative at an off-critical zero. Since the affine nature of the derivative is both necessary (by symmetry) and impossible (by structure), the existence of off-critical zeros is refuted. As the Riemann ξ(s) function is a member of this class, all of its non-trivial zeros must lie on the critical line. The Riemann Hypothesis therefore holds unconditionally.

                    <strong>Version 2.1.1 (July 7, 2025):</strong>
                    <div class="change-remark">
                        A minor textual refinement to further improve logical transparency. The justification for the function's order in the 'Growth Properties' section has been expanded to explicitly include the role of the Hadamard Factorization Theorem, making the non-circular nature of the argument more direct.

                    <div class="change-remark">
                        A minor update focused on improving clarity and logical rigor. The justifications for the growth properties have been enriched and their logical placement in the manuscript improved. Additionally, new explanatory remarks have been added to the Affine Forcing Engine to clarify its mechanism and robustness.

                    <div class="change-remark">
                        This version introduces major structural and conceptual revisions. A flaw in the original "Line-To-Line Mapping Theorem" has been addressed by replacing it with a more rigorous Affine Forcing Engine, built upon a fully justified Boundedness Lemma. Furthermore, the paper has been substantially restructured: the "Clash of Natures" argument is now presented as the primary, unified proof in the main text, while the "Pure Algebraic" refutation has been moved to an appendix as a complete, alternative track.
