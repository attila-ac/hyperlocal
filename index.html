        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The Riemann Hypothesis posits that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. This paper presents an unconditional proof of this hypothesis. The argument proceeds by <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, demonstrating that the assumption of any hypothetical off-critical zero for a transcendental entire function sharing the key symmetries of the Riemann ξ-function leads to an inescapable contradiction, irrespective of the zero's order.
        </p>
        <p>
            The refutation is executed in three stages. First, the assumption of an off-critical zero forces a necessary factorization of the function, which in turn imposes a rigid linear recurrence relation on the Taylor coefficients of the resulting quotient function. Second, a direct analysis proves that for any off-critical zero, this recurrence is universally unstable. This instability forces an exponential growth pattern on the coefficients that is incompatible with the requirement for the quotient function to be an entire function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third, the proof refutes the only remaining theoretical possibility: a fine-tuned cancellation of this instability. This is achieved by demonstrating that the conditions required for cancellation, when combined with the function's other symmetries, impose an overdetermined system of linear equations. As verified for foundational cases (multiplicity k=1 and k=2), this system admits only the trivial solution, leading to a terminal contradiction. Since the assumption of an off-critical zero is untenable, no such zeros can exist. The Riemann Hypothesis therefore holds unconditionally.

                    <div class="change-remark">
                        This significant update within the v3 algebraic track solidifies the proof's claim to full generality by extending the computational verification to cover multiple zeros. The previous verification was limited to simple zeros (k=1). This version overcomes that obstacle using a sophisticated analytical shortcut based on Faà di Bruno's formula, enabling the successful verification for the foundational double zero case (k=2). This demonstrated the same pattern of immediate and stable algebraic overdetermination, closing a key theoretical gap. To further enhance clarity, this version also introduces a new 'Boundary of Stability' analysis—which is strategically placed as a post-proof discussion to preserve the minimalist focus of the main argument—and adds a comprehensive summary table for the proof's core algebraic engine.

                    <strong>Version 3.2 (July 24, 2025):</strong>
                    <div class="change-remark">
                        This version corrects a critical logical gap in the final contradiction argument of v3.1. It replaces a previous heuristic with a rigorous, formal derivation of the necessary additional constraints using a Taylor series truncation and null space analysis. The updated appendix presents a complete and computationally verifiable proof that the full system of symmetry constraints has full rank, forcing the contradiction.

                    <div class="change-remark">
                        This version enhances the rigor of the final proof. The computational verification appendix is restructured, and a new remark on "Constructive Impossibility" is added to the methodology section.

                    <div class="change-remark">
                        This major revision corrects a flaw in the previous growth-based proof frameworks and fully develops the purely algebraic track. It introduces the asymptotic proof of the recurrence's universal instability and closes the final logical gap with a computational proof of an overdetermined system of linear equations.

                    <div class="change-remark">
                        A minor textual refinement to further improve logical transparency. The justification for the function's order in the 'Growth Properties' section has been expanded to explicitly include the role of the Hadamard Factorization Theorem, making the non-circular nature of the argument more direct.

                        A minor update focused on improving clarity and logical rigor. The justifications for the growth properties have been enriched and their logical placement in the manuscript improved.
