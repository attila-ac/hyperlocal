        <h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta
  function lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. This paper gives an unconditional
  proof by <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, assuming the existence of a single off-critical
  zero of the Riemann &xi;-function and deriving a structural impossibility.
</p>

<p>
  The argument is entirely <i>hyperlocal</i>: we analyze the analytic and algebraic
  consequences of the factorization &xi;(s) = R<sub>&rho;',k</sub>(s) &middot; G(s) in a small
  neighborhood of the hypothetical zero &rho;', relying exclusively on the unconditional
  properties of &xi; (entire of order 1, functional equation, and reality symmetry).
</p>

<p><b>Stage 1.</b><br>
  Factoring out the Minimal Model R<sub>&rho;',k</sub> forces the Taylor coefficients
  of G(s) to satisfy a finite recurrence. An algebraic certificate (the Stability Discriminant)
  shows that the characteristic roots are strictly separated from the unit circle for every
  off-critical geometry. This hyperbolic splitting produces a unique decaying solution—the
  analytic solution enforced by entire growth.
</p>

<p><b>Stage 2.</b><br>
  Transporting the functional equation and reality symmetry to the off-critical center yields the
  Taylor Alternation Condition (TAC), a finite Toeplitz transport of the FE/RC parity constraints.
  Evaluating TAC on the analytic solution produces a non-zero Symmetry–Entirety Gap. A homogeneous
  correction is therefore forced, but any such correction must lie entirely in the stable spectral
  subspace; this is the Quartet Cancellation Condition (QCC). A hyperlocal arithmetic argument proves
  the non-vanishing of the Symmetry–Entirety Gap; in the sine normal form this is witnessed finitely
  by the two primes p &isin; {2,3}.
</p>

<p><b>Stage 3.</b><br>
  Symmetry and stability jointly impose the coupled linear system
  B<sub>cpl</sub>(&sigma;,t) &middot; &Gamma; = y<sub>cpl</sub>(&rho;'), where &Gamma; is the central
  derivative jet of &xi;. The Rank–Genericity Lemma establishes that B<sub>cpl</sub>(&sigma;,t) has full
  column rank on an open dense subset of the off-critical domain, making the system generically
  unsolvable because y<sub>cpl</sub>(&rho;') &ne; 0 (equivalently d(&rho;') &ne; 0).
</p>

<p>
  Since no consistent analytic factor G(s) can exist under the assumption of an off-critical zero,
  the assumption is impossible. Therefore all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on
  the critical line: The Riemann Hypothesis holds.

            <h2>Versioning Information</h2>
            <ul>

              <li>
  <strong>Version 4.1 (February 10, 2026):</strong>
  <div class="change-remark">
    This revision is a notation- and architecture-alignment pass motivated by the Lean formalisation protocol.
    <br><br>
    First, the arithmetic non-vanishing input is sharpened to a finite two-prime witness: in the sine normal form,
    the Symmetry–Entirety Gap is certified using p &isin; {2,3}, removing residual “generic prime” wording at the
    Stage 3 coupling point.
    <br><br>
    Second, Stage 3 is reformulated as a single canonical coupled system: the stacked operator
    B<sub>cpl</sub>(&sigma;,t) and load vector y<sub>cpl</sub>(&rho;') are defined once in the manuscript and referenced thereafter,
    eliminating duplicated or swapped block displays.
    <br><br>
    Third, remaining proof obligations are localised into a small number of sharply isolated semantic inputs,
    with all other steps reduced to window-level linear algebra and definitional transport, matching an end-to-end
    Lean-verifiable architecture.

    <strong>Version 4.0 (November 2025):</strong>
    <div class="change-remark">
        This update incorporates several structural corrections and clarifications,
        informed in part by detailed informal feedback from Professor Peter Varju.
        <br><br>
        First, the reductio hypothesis is now applied exclusively to the Riemann
        &xi;–function. Earlier drafts extended the framework to a broader class of
        four-fold symmetric entire functions, where explicit counterexamples
        (including Varju’s cosine–product constructions) are known. This version
        removes that category error and restricts the argument to its proper analytic
        setting.
        <br><br>
        Second, the recurrence analysis has been reformulated in a fully centered
        form. By separating the analytic forcing from the homogeneous component,
        the update eliminates the inhomogeneity bleed-through affecting earlier
        versions and removes hidden dependence on the tail of the forcing vector.
        <br><br>
        Third, the concluding contradiction is now expressed through a hyperlocal
        coupling operator. The Toeplitz-transported symmetry constraints (TAC) and
        the quartet-based stability constraints (QCC) are combined into a
        parameter-dependent matrix. A real-analytic rank analysis shows that this
        operator has full column rank \(3k\) for a generic set of off-critical
        geometries, yielding a uniform contradiction across all multiplicities.
        <br><br>
        Further refinements are expected as the approach continues to undergo
        scrutiny and external feedback.

                    <strong>Version 3.3 (August 9, 2025):</strong>
                    <div class="change-remark">
                        This significant update within the v3 algebraic track solidifies the proof's claim to full generality by extending the computational verification to cover multiple zeros. The previous verification was limited to simple zeros (k=1). This version overcomes that obstacle using a sophisticated analytical shortcut based on Faà di Bruno's formula, enabling the successful verification for the foundational double zero case (k=2). This demonstrated the same pattern of immediate and stable algebraic overdetermination, closing a key theoretical gap. To further enhance clarity, this version also introduces a new 'Boundary of Stability' analysis—which is strategically placed as a post-proof discussion to preserve the minimalist focus of the main argument—and adds a comprehensive summary table for the proof's core algebraic engine.

                    <div class="change-remark">
                        This version corrects a critical logical gap in the final contradiction argument of v3.1. It replaces a previous heuristic with a rigorous, formal derivation of the necessary additional constraints using a Taylor series truncation and null space analysis. The updated appendix presents a complete and computationally verifiable proof that the full system of symmetry constraints has full rank, forcing the contradiction.

                        This version enhances the rigor of the final proof. The computational verification appendix is restructured, and a new remark on "Constructive Impossibility" is added to the methodology section.

                        This major revision corrects a flaw in the previous growth-based proof frameworks and fully develops the purely algebraic track. It introduces the asymptotic proof of the recurrence's universal instability and closes the final logical gap with a computational proof of an overdetermined system of linear equations.

                        A minor textual refinement to further improve logical transparency. The justification for the function's order in the 'Growth Properties' section has been expanded to explicitly include the role of the Hadamard Factorization Theorem, making the non-circular nature of the argument more direct.

                        This version introduces major structural and conceptual revisions. A flaw in the original "Line-To-Line Mapping Theorem" has been addressed by replacing it with a more rigorous Affine Forcing Engine.
