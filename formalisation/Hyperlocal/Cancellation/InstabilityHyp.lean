Abstract hypothesis: the homogeneous recurrence of order `3k` at `(A,t)` has
a characteristic root with modulus `> 1`. This is only a hook; `InstabilityK1/K2`
will provide concrete instances.

We keep it as a `Prop`-class with a trivial inhabitant so it acts like an on/off flag.
If later you want to store an explicit witness `λ` and a polynomial identity,
add fields here instead.

Minimal bridge API from the recurrence/series side to the jet constraints.

* `seed_nontrivial`: from instability we can produce a *nonzero* seed jet.
* `forces_fine`: any such nonzero seed must satisfy both QCC and TRC at `(A₀,t₀)`.

You’ll discharge this later using `Recurrence.lean` (and any analytic inputs you choose).

**Bridge theorem (abstract).**

Assume:
* `bridge : BridgeData k A t` — the recurrence/series layer forces fine-tuning from any nonzero seed;
* `combine_only_zero` — your Combine lemma: at `(A₀,t₀)`, the only fine-tuned jet is `0`;
* `[UnstableHom k A t]` — the instability hook has been discharged (e.g. in `InstabilityK1/K2`).

Then the fine-tuned cancellation scenario is impossible (contradiction).
