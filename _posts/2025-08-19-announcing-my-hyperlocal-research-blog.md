title: "Announcing a Research Blog on the Hyperlocal Proof"
author: "Attila Csordas"

Welcome to my new research blog! 

I've started this blog to provide commentary and updates related to my ongoing 2000+ hours research project and paper, "Off-Critical Riemann Zeta Zeros Cannot Seed Symmetric Entire Functions: A Hyperlocal Proof of Constructive Impossibility."

I plan to post about:
- Actual events and history of the project and hyperlocal framework.
- Technical deep dives into the proof machinery.
- Responses to feedback and frequently asked questions.

Thank you for your interest in this work.
