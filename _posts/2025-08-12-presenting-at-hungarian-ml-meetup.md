title: "First Public Talk on the Hyperlocal RH Proof in Budapest"
author: "Attila Csordas"
---

Last week, I had the first opportunity to publicly discuss my ongoing 'Riemann Hypothesis' project at the **Hungarian Machine Learning Meetup 2025**. The conference was hosted in my native Budapest by the HUN-REN SZTAKI (Institute for Computer Science and Control), and it was a fantastic venue to share this work.

My talk focused on two main themes:

**1. A New Angle on a Very Old Problem** üìê

I introduced the distinctively human "game opening" strategy of hyperlocal analysis, which provides a new and minimalist attack angle on the Riemann Hypothesis. The goal was to give the audience a teaser for the full argument and encourage them to explore the research paper.

The complete paper is available here: [https://attila-ac.github.io/hyperlocal/](https://attila-ac.github.io/hyperlocal/)

**2. Navigating Research with AI Co-pilots** ü§ñ

I also presented a series of case studies from the 2,000+ hours of research. These highlighted instances where supposedly 'standard subtasks' were either executed incorrectly by, or initial errors made by myself were not detected by, some of the LLMs I used as assistants. This served as a practical look at the current limitations and pitfalls of using AI in deep research. More on this later.

It was a rewarding experience to present the project and receive feedback from the community. Thank you to the organizers at SZTAKI for the invitation!
