# A Hyperlocal Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis

This repository contains the manuscript and a one-page summary of a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.

## Versioning Information

* **Version 2.1 (Latest):** `hyperlocal_RH_proof_ACs_v2.1_06072025.pdf` available at [GitHub](https://github.com/attila-ac/hyperlocal).
    * *Change remark:* A minor update focused on improving clarity and logical rigor. The justifications for the growth properties have been enriched and their logical placement in the manuscript improved. Additionally, new explanatory remarks have been added to the Affine Forcing Engine to clarify its mechanism and robustness.

* **Version 2:** `hyperlocal_RH_proof_ACs_v2_04072025.pdf` available at [GitHub](https://github.com/attila-ac/hyperlocal).
    * *Change remark:* This version introduces major structural and conceptual revisions. A flaw in the original "Line-To-Line Mapping Theorem" has been addressed by replacing it with a more rigorous *Affine Forcing Engine*, built upon a fully justified Boundedness Lemma. Furthermore, the paper has been substantially restructured: the "Clash of Natures" argument is now presented as the primary, unified proof in the main text, while the "Pure Algebraic" refutation has been moved to an appendix as a complete, alternative track. This reflects a key conceptual refinement: the minimal model polynomial is not subject to the conclusions of the Affine Forcing Engine, because as a polynomial, it inherently fails to satisfy the required growth properties (specifically, the vertical decay condition). This refined understanding clarifies the model's role as a purely algebraic diagnostic tool and has led to the removal of the previous "Ultimate Supporting Evidence" section.
